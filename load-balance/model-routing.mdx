title: Multi-Model Routing (In Development) ðŸ‘€
description: ''
---

1Router.com is currently developing multi-model routing capabilities. In the meantime, two options are available:

1. **Auto Router**: A special model ID that selects between high-quality models based on heuristics applied to your prompt.
2. **Models Array**: This option allows you to automatically try other models if the primary model's providers are down, rate-limited, or unable to reply due to mandatory content moderation:

```json
{
  "models": ["anthropic/claude-2.1", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
  "route": "fallback",
  // Other parameters
}
